## 🙏 Attribution

This project is a Rust rewrite of the original [kiro-gateway](https://github.com/jwadow/kiro-gateway) by [@Jwadow](https://github.com/jwadow). The original project is written in Python using FastAPI.

**Why Rust?**
- ⚡ Faster startup time and lower memory footprint
- 🔒 Memory safety without garbage collection
- 📦 Single binary deployment — no runtime dependencies

---

## 🤖 Supported Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Claude Opus 4.5** | Most powerful. Complex reasoning, deep analysis, research |
| 🚀 **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | Balanced. Coding, writing, general-purpose |
| ⚡ **Claude Haiku 4.5** | Lightning fast. Quick responses, simple tasks |
| 📦 **Claude Sonnet 4** | Previous generation. Reliable for most use cases |
| 📦 **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** | Legacy model. Backward compatibility |

> 💡 **Smart Model Resolution:** Use any model name format — `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4.5`, or versioned names like `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`. The gateway normalizes them automatically.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔌 **OpenAI-compatible API** | Works with any OpenAI-compatible tool |
| 🔌 **Anthropic-compatible API** | Native `/v1/messages` endpoint |
| 🧠 **Extended Thinking** | Reasoning support |
| 👁️ **Vision Support** | Send images to model |
| 🛠️ **Tool Calling** | Function calling support |
| 💬 **Full message history** | Complete conversation context |
| 📡 **Streaming** | Full SSE streaming support |
| 🔄 **Retry Logic** | Automatic retries on errors |
| 🔐 **Smart token management** | Automatic refresh before expiration |

## 🏗️ Architecture

For detailed architecture documentation including component diagrams, data flows, and implementation details, see:

**[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**

The architecture documentation covers:
- High-level system architecture with Mermaid diagrams
- Request flow sequence diagrams
- Deep dives into all 14 components
- Authentication flow and token management
- Streaming pipeline and thinking parser state machine
- Converter architecture for OpenAI/Anthropic format translation

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+ (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/cli/) installed and logged in with AWS SSO (Builder ID)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rkgw.git
cd rkgw

# Build release binary
cargo build --release

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Run
./target/release/kiro-gateway

# Or with cargo
cargo run --release
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Required - Path to kiro-cli SQLite database
KIRO_CLI_DB_FILE="~/.kiro/data.db"

# Password to protect YOUR proxy server
PROXY_API_KEY="my-super-secret-password-123"

# Optional
KIRO_REGION="us-east-1"
```

The gateway reads credentials from the kiro-cli SQLite database and automatically refreshes tokens before expiration.

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```
